Ross's PowerShell Scripts (Version 5+) Dealing with Data Files and Databases

I work with Data Processing pipelines and in this day and age we still deal with a lot of CSV files.  Enterprise restrictions limit the tools available and PowerShell still allows us to get stuff done.

It's also a place to exercise and showcase some PS skills, the feedback could be brutal ;)
